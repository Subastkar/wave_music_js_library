This is a Javascript library created to interact with the Wave Music API.

To use this library you must include the jQuery library in your app, you may
find it in this repo too.

The library have a constructor that create an instance that you can manage from
the 'wm' object.

The methods implemented are:

  Get methods:
  - getSongs(callback)
  - getSong(id, callback)
  - getPlaylists(callback)
  - getPlaylist(id, callback)

  Post methods:
  - logIn(email, password, callback)
  - createPlaylist(name_of_playlist, callback)
  - addSongs(playlist_id, songs_id, callback)
    // In this case the songs_id is an array of the ids of each
    // song you want to add.

  Delete methods:
  - logOut(user_id, callback)

This is a example for a get method:

  wm.getSongs(function(data){
    console.log(data);
  })

Wich will print the json obteined from the API request.
